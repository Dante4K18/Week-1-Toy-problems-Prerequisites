# JavaScript Toy Problems Solutions

This repository contains solutions to three JavaScript toy problems. Each problem is solved in its own file.

## Challenges

### Challenge 1: Student Grade Generator

This function prompts the user to input student marks. The input should be between 0 and 100. The output corresponds to the correct grade:

- A: > 79
- B: 60 to 79
- C: 49 to 59
- D: 40 to 49
- E: Less than 40

### Challenge 2: Speed Detector

This program takes the speed of a car as input and evaluates it:

- If the speed is less than 70, it prints “Ok”.
- Otherwise, for every 5 km/s above the speed limit (70), it gives the driver one demerit point and prints the total number of demerit points.
- If the driver gets more than 12 points, the function prints: “License suspended”.

### Challenge 3: Net Salary Calculator

This program calculates an individual’s Net Salary by taking inputs for basic salary and benefits. It calculates:

- PAYE (Tax)
- NHIF Deductions
- NSSF Deductions
- Gross Salary
- Net Salary

The calculations use values from KRA, NHIF, and NSSF.
